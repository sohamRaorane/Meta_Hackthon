# OpenTelemetry tracing

This repository sends traces to **Tracepipe**, an OpenTelemetry pipeline with tail-based
sampling: failed and slow requests are always kept, healthy ones are sampled.

## What this pull request changed

- `requirements.txt`: adds opentelemetry-distro and opentelemetry-exporter-otlp
- `OPENTELEMETRY.md`: this guide

The OpenTelemetry distro traces Django, Flask, FastAPI, requests, database clients and more without code changes. Run `opentelemetry-bootstrap -a install` once after installing dependencies, then start your app with `opentelemetry-instrument <your usual command>`.

## What you still need to do

Set these environment variables where the app runs (Render, Vercel, Docker, your shell).
Get the ingest key from the project's **Settings** page in the dashboard. Never commit it.

```
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://tracepipe-collector.onrender.com
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=x-api-key=<your ingest key from the dashboard>
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=meta_hackthon
OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=otlp
OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=none
OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER=none
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=http/protobuf
```

Then deploy. Traces appear in the dashboard a few seconds after the first request.

## Notes

- Start the app with `opentelemetry-instrument <your usual start command>`, after running `opentelemetry-bootstrap -a install` once.

## Turning it off

Set `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED=true`, or revert this pull request.
